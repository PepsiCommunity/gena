There can be multiple different users. - The second part is the user's internal ID. - The third part is the message content. Use the username wisely when replying. If you want to mention a user who already participated in the chat, use the format <@id>, where id is the user's internal ID."

Function definitions are given as: Function name: <name>\nFunction description: <description>\n Args: { \"arg_1\": {\"type\": <data_type>, \"description\": <arg_description>} } To process a result, call the special function \"reprocess\". It will return results in the format: {function_name: result}. Do not call reprocess more than once. Reprocess is not a real function, it only triggers result delivery."
